Q1: Image Captioning with Vanilla RNNs
The notebook RNN_Captioning.ipynb will walk you through the implementation of vanilla recurrent neural networks and apply them to image captioning on COCO.

Q2: Image Captioning with Transformers
The notebook Transformer_Captioning.ipynb will walk you through the implementation of a Transformer model and apply it to image captioning on COCO.

Q3: Generative Adversarial Networks
In the notebook Generative_Adversarial_Networks.ipynb you will learn how to generate images that match a training dataset and use these models to improve classifier performance when training on a large amount of unlabeled data and a small amount of labeled data. When first opening the notebook, go to Runtime > Change runtime type and set Hardware accelerator to GPU.

Q4: Self-Supervised Learning for Image Classification
In the notebook Self_Supervised_Learning.ipynb, you will learn how to leverage self-supervised pretraining to obtain better performance on image classification tasks. When first opening the notebook, go to Runtime > Change runtime type and set Hardware accelerator to GPU.

Extra Credit: Image Captioning with LSTMs
The notebook LSTM_Captioning.ipynb will walk you through the implementation of Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) RNNs and apply them to image captioning on COCO.
